# COVID-19 Dashboard programming project

Description
------------
The aim of this programming project was to design a user interface which displayed news articles relating to COVID-19 as well as COVID data concerning Exeter and England. The news articles have been filtered so only those with the key terms "covid", "covid-19" and "coronavirus" are shown.
